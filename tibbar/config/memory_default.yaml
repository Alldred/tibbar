# Default memory config: separate instruction and data banks to exercise full pipeline.
# Instruction bank: read-write-execute (rwx) so self-modifying code sequences are possible.
# Data bank: read-write (rw) - load/store data goes here.
# boot: fixed absolute execution address (0 is allowed). Omit for randomised boot.
# For a single-RAM linker script, use a one-bank config (e.g. config/memory_single_ram.yaml).
